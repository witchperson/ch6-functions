# Exercise 2: using built-in string functions

# Create a variable `lyric` that contains the text "I like to eat apples and 
# bananas"
lyric <- "I like to eat apples and bananas"

# Use the `substr()` function to extract the 1st through 13th letters from the `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `intro`
# Use `?substr` to see more about this function
intro <- substr(lyric, 1, 13)
print(intro)
# Use the `substr()` function to extract the 15th through the last letter of the 
# `lyric`, and store the result in a variable called `fruits`
# Hint: use `nchar()` to determine how many letters there are!
fruits <- substr(lyric, 15, nchar(lyric))
print(fruits)
# Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "ee".
# Store the result in a variable called `fruits.e`
# Hint: see http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/sub.php for a simpmle example (or 
# use `?gsub`)
fruits.e <- gsub("a", "ee", lyric)
print(fruits.e)
# Use the `gsub()` function to substitute all the "a"s in `fruits` with "o".
# Store the result in a variable called `fruits.o`
fruits.o <- gsub("a", "o", lyric)
print(fruits.o)
# Create a new variable `lyric.e` that is the `intro` combined with the new
# `fruits.e` ending. Print out this variable
lyric.e <- paste(intro, fruits.e)
print(lyric.e)
# Without making a new variable, print out the `intro` combined with the new
# `fruits.o` ending
print((paste(intro, fruits.o)))
